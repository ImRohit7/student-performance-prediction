# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict student academic performance (Pass/Fail) using machine learning techniques based on academic and behavioral factors such as marks and attendance.

## Motivation
Early identification of students at academic risk can help institutions provide timely academic support and improve overall student outcomes.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis on student academic data
- Build and evaluate a machine learning classification model
- Predict student performance as Pass or Fail

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Project Structure
- dataset/ : Contains datasets used for training and testing
- notebooks/ : Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling
- results/ : Output files and visualizations

## Current Status

# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict student academic performance (Pass/Fail) using machine learning techniques based on academic and behavioral factors such as marks and attendance.

## Motivation
Early identification of students at academic risk can help institutions provide timely academic support and improve overall student outcomes.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis on student academic data
- Build and evaluate a machine learning classification model
- Predict student performance as Pass or Fail

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Project Structure
- dataset/ : Contains datasets used for training and testing
- notebooks/ : Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling
- results/ : Output files and visualizations

## Current Status
🚧 Phase 1: Problem definition and project setup completed
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Student Performance Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It contains academic and behavioral attributes of students, including grades, study time, and past failures.

The target variable is derived from the final grade (G3):
- Pass: G3 ≥ 10
- Fail: G3 < 10
